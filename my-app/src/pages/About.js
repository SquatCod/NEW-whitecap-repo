                <hr/>
                At Whitecap Scientific we're creating a world where 3D insight is always
                available to support subsea decisions. We were the first company to bring 
                live video-based 3D reconstruction subsea, and we've been focused on removing
                the operational and commercial complexity that prevents subsea 
                professionals from getting 3D insight whenever they need it.
